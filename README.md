## Features

-   Bridges between Discord and Hypixel guild chats.
-   Sends all guild related messages, including chat, guild announcements and more to Discord.
-   Automatic restarts and reconnections.
-   Toggleable use of Discord emojis for Hypixel ranks in chat messages.
-   Privileged slash commands to control bot behaviour in-game.
-   Toggleable slowmode to slow and control member usage.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >=16.6.0 and npm
-   A full access Minecraft Java Edition account

### Setup

1. ‚≠ê Star this repository!
2. Clone the repository into a directory of your choice.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MiscGuild/bridge.git
```

3. Enter the new directory and install packages.

```bash
$ cd bridge
$ npm install
```

4. Make a new Discord bot account on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and retrieve the bot token.

5. Under the `Bot` tab, grant the bot the `Message Content` Intent.

6. Generate an invite URL by going to the OAuth2 tab and clicking on the URL Generator. Add the `bot` and `application.commands` scopes, before opening the link to invite the bot to your server.

7. Fill out the `.env.template` file with your credentials and rename it to `.env`.

8. Remove the `.template` file endings from `src/util/_blacklist.json.template` and `src/util/emojis/_emojiIds.json.template`.

9. Promote the Minecraft account the bot uses to Officer in-game in order for it to view the Officer chat and run privileged commands.

10. Build and run the bot.

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

Optionally, you may activate the use of rank emojis in discord messages by following these steps:

1. Run the `/emojis upload` command in a discord server of your choice. (Note: It is recommended to run this command in an alternate server, as it uses a significant number of emoji slots. In this case, only the user of id `BOT_OWNER_ID` is the only person with permission to run this command).

2. Set the value of `USE_RANK_EMOJIS` in the `.env` file to `true` (Use `false` to disable this feature).

If at any time you wish to delete the emojis created by the bot, run the `/emojis remove` command.
